*the contents of this project are confidential*

We are aiming to develop a mobile application that will be focusing on reducing the above mentioned problems.
We are introducing the concept of “MedHelpers” who will be the trained professionals having knowledge of giving proper FIRST AID. 
The “MedHelpers” hired by us will be certified to provide FIRST AID skills. Also, normal citizens can volunteer as  the “CitizenMedHelpers” and can earn some extra money whenever they feel like. 
The app will be used to call “MedHelpers” in vicinity of the user who will be there to provide the user with the FIRST AID immediately whenever any emergency occurs (like knee injuries, heart attacks etc) just by pressing an SOS button in the app.
MediC app can also be used for delivery of medicines. These “MedHelpers” will also be responsible for delivering required medicines to the user.

 The user can also check the availability and compare the prices of the required medicine in the nearby medical stores if the user wants to buy the medicine on his/her own by using Medic app.
MediC app will also allow the different medical stores to have their own ONLINE DATABASE for details (like availability, prices, stock etc) of  different medicines in their shops using Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP).
